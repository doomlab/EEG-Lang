@article{Maki2008,
	Abstract = {There has been much debate about the relation between knowledge for meaning (semantic memory) and knowledge for words in context (associative memory). Many measures of that knowledge exist, but do they all measure the same thing? In this study, scaling, clustering, and factor-analytic techniques were used to reveal the structure underlying 13 variables. Semantic similarity determined from lexicographic measures is shown to be separable from the associative strength determined from word association norms, and these semantic and associative measures are in turn separable from abstract representations derived from computational analyses of large bodies of text. The three-factor structure is at odds with traditional views of word knowledge. The ex- pression of long-term knowledge about words and the concepts they represent may be better viewed in terms of associative, semantic, and thematic information.},

@article{Lau2013,
	Abstract = {When a word is preceded by a supportive context such as a semantically associated word or a strongly constraining sentence frame, the N400 component of the ERP is reduced in amplitude. An ongoing debate is the degree to which this reduction reflects a passive spread of activation across long-term semantic memory representations as opposed to specific predictions about upcoming input. We addressed this question by embedding semantically associated prime--target pairs within an experimental context that encouraged prediction to a greater or lesser degree. The proportion of related items was used to manipulate the predictive validity of the prime for the target while holding semantic association constant. A semantic category probe detection task was used to encourage semantic processing and to preclude the need for a motor response on the trials of interest. A larger N400 reduction to associated targets was observed in the high than the low relatedness proportion condition, consistent with the hypothesis that...},

	Abstract = {Lexical decisions to word targets preceded by associatively related word primes are generally faster than those to words following neutral primes, whereas, under certain circumstances, lexical decisions to words preceded by unassociated word primes are slower than those to words following neutral primes. An experiment is reported that investigates the influence of the proportion of related prime-target pairs in the set of materials and of the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) of prime and target on these associative priming effects. Four levels of proportion and three levels of SOA are systematically varied. Both variables are found to affect the size of the associative priming effects. Furthermore, the data suggest interdependence between them. The magnitude of priming only varies with SOA if the proportion of related pairs is relatively large. In contrast, the amount of priming varies with proportion under all SOA conditions. The data are interpreted primarily in terms of two contextual processes, viz., ``...},

	Abstract = {As researchers explore the complexity of memory and language hierarchies, the need to expand normed stimulus databases is growing. Therefore, we present 1,808 words, paired with their features and concept-concept information, that were collected using previously established norming methods (McRae, Cree, Seidenberg, {\&} McNorgan Behavior Research Methods 37:547-559, 2005). This database supplements existing stimuli and complements the Semantic Priming Project (Hutchison, Balota, Cortese, Neely, Niemeyer, Bengson, {\&} Cohen-Shikora 2010). The data set includes many types of words (including nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), expanding on previous collections of nouns and verbs (Vinson {\&} Vigliocco Journal of Neurolinguistics 15:317-351, 2008). We describe the relation between our and other semantic norms, as well as giving a short review of word-pair norms. The stimuli are provided in conjunction with a searchable Web portal that allows researchers to create a set of experimental stimuli without prior programming knowledge. When researchers use this new database in tandem with previous norming efforts, precise stimuli sets can be created for future research endeavors.},
