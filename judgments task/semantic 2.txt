When compared, the words TORTOISE and SNAIL are found to have 
characteristics that are fairly similar, but there are almost 
as many dissimilar traits as there are similar. For example, 
both animals are reptiles and have exoskeleton shells. However 
a tortoise is a reptile and a snail is a mollusk. This means 
that the characteristics only moderately overlap. Although 
TORTOISE and SNAIL share many of the same taxonomy traits, the 
psychological concepts shared by TORTOISE and SNAIL differ from 
the taxonomical traits in the sense that the psychological traits 
separate the two concepts more than taxonomy would.
