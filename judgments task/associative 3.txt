Psychologists are interested in understanding the structure of associative 
memory and have several ways of investigating it. One method of investigating 
associative memory is known as a test of "free association." In free association 
tests, participants like you are given a series of words and are asked to respond 
to each word by writing the first word that pops into mind. 

You will be asked to judge two words based on their association. When you do this think about this:
Assume 100 college students from around the nation gave responses to each CUE word.
How many of these 100 students do you think would have given the RESPONSE word?
