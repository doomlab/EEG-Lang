Associative Instructions:
This experiment is partially concerned with the structure of human
associative memory. Consider the word (and concept of) DOG. We know 
that dogs breathe, eat, sleep, have four legs, have tails, are generally 
friendly toward humans, and, for some of these reasons, are related to 
other animals like cats. All this knowledge is structured in some way 
and the mental structure is thought to come about through a process of
associative learning.
