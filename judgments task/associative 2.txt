So, for example, we often see the word DOG appear in the same context 
as the word CAT. "It's raining cats and dogs." "I have two dogs, but 
my neighbor has a cat." And so on. By experiencing the words CAT and 
DOG together many times, we develop an association (a mental connection) 
between them. With lots of this kind of associative learning experience 
during our lives, we develop a very large and very complex associative memory.
