Semantic Instructions:
This experiment is partially concerned with how humans perceive similarities 
between the characteristics which define words. Consider the word (and concept of) 
TORTOISE. We know that a TORTOISE is a reptile with an exoskeleton and a hard 
shell. If we compare the word TORTOISE with the word TURTLE, we find that they 
share a majority of the same features. Therefore their definitions or 
characteristics overlap greatly.
