If we compare the word TORTOISE with the word BANNER we find that there 
is very little which these two objects have in common. TORTOISE and 
BANNER are so dissimilar because the concepts of what make a TORTOISE 
and what make a BANNER hardly overlap at all. For example they are both 
physical objects, but a TORTOISE is animate and a BANNER is inanimate.  

In this experiment, you will be judging words on their semantic feature overlap.
You will be shown two words and will decide how many features they share.
